          Pivot is a modern 3D game engine.
          <br>
          Programmed from scratch, its objective is to use the modern graphic cards capacities to their maximum.
          <br>
          Our engine aims to implement 3D functionalities considered as modern and innovative.
          <br>
          Those include raytracing and physically based rendering.
          <br>
          Pivot engine will be compatible with tools and formats considered as industry standard, thus making it easy to integrate to any project.
          <br><br>
          This project is still in development.
